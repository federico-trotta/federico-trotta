# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Federico Trotta 

I'm a Data Scientist who loves wrintig code and sharing knowledge, writing articles.

As an engineer, I've always loved data and graphs, but when I discovered Data Science it was love at first sight.
Data Science gives me the opportunity to apply mathematics - one of the disciplines I love most - to real business cases, helping companies to grow and improve.

I'm currently working in manufacturing and, in the last year, I have helped my company to get results from data.
Now, I would like to work in the Technological and Digital world, as a Data Scientist.
