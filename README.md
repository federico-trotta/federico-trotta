# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Federico Trotta 

I'm a Data Scientist who loves wrintig code and sharing knowledge, writing articles.

As an Engineer, I've always loved data and graphs, but when I discovered Data Science it was love at first sight.
Data Science gives me the opportunity to apply mathematics - one of the disciplines I love the most - to real business cases, helping companies to grow and improve.

I'm currently working in Manufacturing and I have helped my company to get results from data.
Now, I would like to work in the Technological and Digital world, as a Data Scientist.

# Some projects I made

On my [GitHub](https://github.com/federico-trotta) you can see my projects, so that you can understand my expertise in Data Science, Machine Learning and Python, but let me show you some project I'm particulaty proud of:

- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/wine_marketplace_strategy) I made a data-driven strategy for a wine marketplace. Analyzing data I was able to help an hypotetical customer to buy a certain number of bottle of wine, spending a certain amount of money.

- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/Predicting_fetal_diseases_with_ML) you find an analysis I made on a fetal dataset using Machine Learning to predict fetal deseases. 

# My writings activity
As said before, I really love to share my learnings and to help people undestrand Data Science ad AI concepts;  if you want to read my contents, you may find interesting my [MEDIUM](https://medium.com/@federicotrotta) profile. I've written a lot of technical articles as well as informative ones with tips and trick on code and Data Science.

If you don't know where to start, you can start reading from [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/technical_articles) where you find a kind of summary of my best articles.
