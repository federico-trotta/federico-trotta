# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Federico Trotta 

I'm a Technical Writer who loves writing code and sharing knowledge through technical articles.


# Some projects I made
ðŸ”­
On my [GitHub](https://github.com/federico-trotta) you can see all my projects in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Python. But let me show you some projects I'm particularly proud of:

- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/wine_marketplace_strategy) I made a data-driven strategy for a wine marketplace. Analyzing data I was able to help a hypothetical customer to buy a certain number of bottles of wine, spending a certain amount of money.

- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/Predicting_fetal_diseases_with_ML) you find an analysis I made on a fetal dataset using Machine Learning to predict fetal diseases. 

# My writing activity
I started my career writing about Python and Machine Learning.

Today, while I still write about these topics, I also love to work with product and API documentation.

In [my portfolio](https://federico-trotta.gitbook.io/federico-trottas-portfolio/), you'll see all my expertise as a Technical Writer.

# Let's connect together
